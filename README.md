# Torch-Gauge

A light-weight [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) extension for efficient gauge-equivariant learning.

Torch-Gauge is a library to boost geometric learning on physical data structures
with Lie-group symmetry and beyond two-body interactions. GPU and mini-batch training
utilities are natively supported.
